      <h2>Dan Turèll</h2>

      <div class="person-text">

        <p>
        Dan Turèll (1946–1993), known as "Onkel Danny" (Uncle Danny), was a highly popular and prolific Danish author, poet, and journalist. Known for his distinctive style — including his iconic black-painted nails and love for jazz and urban life — he became one of Denmark’s most recognisable literary voices.

        <p>
        Born and raised in Vangede, Turèll wrote extensively about Copenhagen and everyday city life. His works often blended poetry, reportage and personal reflection, creating a unique voice that captured the rhythm and atmosphere of the Danish capital. He published nearly 100 books during his lifetime, including the famous <em>Vangedebilleder</em> (1975) and his beloved crime series.

        Turèll was deeply inspired by American beat poetry and jazz culture, influences that shaped both his writing style and public persona. Today, he remains an iconic figure in Danish cultural history — celebrated not only for his literary contributions but for his vivid portrayal of Copenhagen’s streets, people and nightlife.
